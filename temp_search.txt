According to mdf-rs research, after getting boot page:
1. Boot page points to first system indices page
2. System catalog is self-describing using:
   - sysrowsets (partition metadata)
   - sysallocunits (page allocation info)
   - sysschobjs (object definitions)
   - syscolpars (column definitions)

The key is that these system tables reference each other by object_id.
For SQL Server 2005+, known system object IDs are:
- sysrowsets: object_id = 5
- sysallocunits: object_id = 7
- sysschobjs: object_id = 34
- syscolpars: object_id = 41

The firstSysIndices page should contain sysallocunits records.
Each sysallocunits record has:
- alloc_unit_id (8 bytes at offset 0)
- type (1 byte at offset 8)
- container_id (8 bytes at offset 9)
- first_page pointer (6 bytes at offset 17 or in variable data)

Let me check if the records I'm reading match this structure.
